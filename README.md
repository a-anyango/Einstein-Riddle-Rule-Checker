# Einstein's Riddle Solution

This repository contains the solution for the Einstein's riddle exercise. The provided C# code includes a class that checks whether the rules for the riddle have been fulfilled. The class has functions that accept relevant arguments, and based on the fulfillment of rules, it prints out success, failure, or a fair outcome along with the rules that have not been fulfilled.

## Instructions
With respect to Einstein's riddle as shared in the link https://www.brainzilla.com/logic/zebra/einsteins-riddle/, 
Come up with a class that has functions (which accept relevant arguments)
One or more of the functions should check whether the rules for riddle have been fulfilled
If the rules are all passed it should print out success
If none are passed it should print out failed
If some of the rules are passed it should print our Fair and output the rules which have not been fulfilled.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the C# script.
2. Open the script in a C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Run the program to see the output based on the fulfillment of the Einstein's riddle rules.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed for your understanding or specific use case.
